/**
 * 👁️ SENSES - API Layer (Stimulators)
 *
 * Entry points that receive external stimuli (HTTP, WebSocket, etc.)
 * and translate them into Neuron calls.
 *
 * Structure:
 * - /rest       → REST API handlers (if applicable)
 * - /websocket  → Real-time handlers
 *
 * Note: In a React SPA, most "Senses" are React components (pages)
 * that call Neurons directly. This folder is for non-UI entry points.
